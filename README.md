At the time of publishing there were no known bugs.

## Technologies Used
The application uses a combination of HTML, CSS and JavaScript to achieve its objectives.HTML was used for the content while CSS was used for styling of the web page. JavaScript was used to make the page interactive.
In addition to those languages, libraries were used in CSS and JavaScript which respectively are bootstrap and jQuery.
Atom was the text editor used to put all the lines of code together for execution.

##Behaviour Driven Development (BDD)
In regards to the quiz, the BDD involved had to take into account the following:
All the questions with multiple can only have one answer.
Validation of all the marks scored wrong should have a value of zero.
When tallying all the scores, correct scores should have a value of 1. 
A response  given should have combined the total value of the correct answers combined.
